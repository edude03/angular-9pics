# Angular-9pics


## Overview
This was a quick little project I wrote to test how easy it would be to cosume an API using Angular.js, it was heavily based on [Rheza's 9pics](https://github.com/rheza/9pics) however this was a clean room implementation (I didn't copy his source)

##Setup
All you need to test this is fork it then load it via a HTTP server, I personally use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` but I'm sure there are other similar options. 

##Notes
This is still a work in progress, some thing don't work yet but I'll probably keep working on this so I have something I can put in my portfolio :P
